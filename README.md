# Indoor-Scene-Using-YOLOV11
Indoor Scene Classification using RCNN + YOLOV11
We have introduced a hybrid Dee learning model, which breaks scenes into smaller parts to ensure related semantic elements can be distinguished well for object detection and classification. The hybrid model combines the real-time detection feature of YOLOv11 with the precision of RCNN to improve system performance. It is optimized using tools such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keraâ€™s to be used in real-time applications, including object tracking, dynamic object monitoring, and security enhancement. Benchmark evaluations show large improvements in terms of accuracy, processing speed, and robustness compared to the traditional methods.
